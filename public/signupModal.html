                    products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you do not accept
                    and agree to be bound
                    by all of the terms of this Agreement, you may not use the Service. We may make changes to this
                    Agreement and to the
                    Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in
                    or requirements of the
                    law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will
                    be posted on the
                    Service, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the

                    advance of the changes by
                    reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue
                    to use the Service
                    after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.

                      through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Progocity.com (each, a "Software
                      Store"). If you choose to
                      make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software
                      Store ("your IAP
                      Account"), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance with the

                      periodic subscription
                      through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will be billed continuously for the subscription

                      subscription will
                      automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when
                      subscribing. If you do not wish
                      your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription,
                      you will need to log in

                      or deleting the Progocity.com

                      If you purchase a subscription through Progocity.com Direct, your subscription will continue indefinitely

                      After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription
                      period, your subscription

                      may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your

                      If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, you
                      remain responsible for any
                      uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method. This may result in a

                      for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your
                      payment will be based on

                      <strong>Tokens and Other Virtual Items.</strong> From time to time, you may be able to purchase,
                      with "real world"
                      money, a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use "virtual
                      items," including but not
                      limited to tokens that are redeemable for other virtual items, such as Super Yes and Highlight
                      (collectively, "Virtual
                      Items"). You are only allowed to purchase Virtual Items from us or our authorized partners through
                      the Service and not in
                      any other way. Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Items represent a limited license right
                      governed by this
                      Agreement. Some Virtual Items may only be used during a set period of time, and upon expiration of
                      the time period, any
                      unused Virtual Items expire. In some cases, we may redeem any unused Virtual Items ourselves at
                      expiration and provide
                      you the feature(s) related thereto so you have no unused Virtual Items when the license period
                      expires, although we are not
                      obligated to do so. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Virtual Items obtained by
                      you are licensed to you,
                      and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to Virtual Items is being transferred
                      or assigned hereunder.
                      This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items. Any Virtual Item
                      balance shown in your
                      account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead
                      constitutes a measurement of the
                      extent of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use; provided, however, that the
                      license granted hereunder to
                      Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, when
                      Progocity.com ceases providing
                      the Service or your account is otherwise terminated. Progocity.com, in its sole discretion, reserves the
                      right to charge fees for the
                      right to access or use Virtual Items and/or may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge.
                      Purchase and use of Virtual
                      Items through a Software Store are subject to such Software Store's terms of service and privacy
                      policy. Progocity.com may manage,
                      regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time. Progocity.com shall have no liability to
                      you or any third party in the
                      event that Progocity.com exercises any such rights. The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you
                      shall not sell, redeem or
                      otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity. Virtual Items may only be redeemed
                      through the Service. ALL
                      PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND
                      NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service provided by Progocity.com
                      that commences
                      immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such Virtual Items. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT Progocity.com

                      ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.

                        Arbitration

                        arbitration is that you have the
                        right to bring an individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent
                        jurisdiction. But whether you

                        By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so,
                        YOU GIVE UP YOUR
                        RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for
                        matters that may be
                        taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR
                        OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR
                        JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute.
                        You are entitled to a fair
                        hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you
                        should note that arbitration
                        proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.
                        Decisions by the
                        arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited
                        reasons.

                        arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that

                        for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for
